		<h1>Collections</h1>
		<p>
			<br>
			<span class="section-heading">Collection Composition</span>
			<br>
			Our game collection is divided into two main categories; console and tabletop. 
			Console will consist of any game with which a video game console is needed to play, 
			such as a PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Wii while the tabletop game collection 
			consists of dice, card, and board games. Console games will be available for one week 
			checkout while the tabletop games will only be available for in library use. Both types 
			of materials will be held at the main desk and can be checked out using a library card. 
			The library will retain one copy of available console titles, one copy of each board game, 
			and two copies of each dice/card based game.
			<br><br>
			<span class="section-heading">Collection Accessibility</span>
			<br>
			All dice, card and board game titles will focus on games that can be completed in 
			under an hour in order to maintain a good play experience for the patrons while giving 
			the players enough time to solidly complete multiple games. The library website will 
			have multiple links to YouTube video tutorial of the tabletop games available, as well 
			as embedded links to game trailers of console games available at the library. This works 
			to show the patrons the materials available and allows them to have a better understanding 
			of the material they are checking out. The board games for example often have a multitude 
			of rules that become intuitive after the first play through, but the accessibility of a 
			video may make it more appealing to patrons who do not want to comb over a difficult rulebook. 
			Furthermore the library will have a scanned PDF of the tabletop games’ rules available to 
			the patrons.

		<h1>Organization</h1>
		<p>
			<br>
			<span class="section-heading">Metadata</span>
			<br>
			To begin, the data about these items will be stored in a database that’s been built to take advantage of FRBR. Because some of these items 
			can have different interpretations, it makes sense to organize the data in this way. 
			<br><br>
			The collection is comprised of two categories of games. Video games, software that is played on specialized devices, 
			and board games, games that are played with physical pieces, usually with a playing board and pieces.
			<br><br>
			The two do share some metadata, description, age rating, release date, and number of players. 
			For video games only, we’d want to track how many discs the game had, and what hardware it is compatible with. And for board games, we’d want to know 
			how many pieces are used, what the average play time is, and how much physical size the game takes up.
			<br><br>
			Attached is a proposed database design for our metadata schema.
			<br><br>
			<span class="section-heading">Physical Organization</span>
			<br>
			The physical collection would have the video games shelved in a similar manner to movies. There would be no genre subdivision, 
			games would simply be organized by type of system they’re playable on and then by title. Disc cases would be prominently displayed with their 
			covers facing outwards, and would be empty. In order to obtain the actual disc, the case would be brought to the front desk and be filled 
			with the appropriate contents from a staff only shelf.
			<br><br>
			The board games would be stacked like books, with the title on their boxes facing outward. There would be no subdivision, the games would simply be 
			organized in alphabetical order. The boxes would be empty, like the video games, and the required components would be handed out by the staff at the checkout desk.
			<br><br>
			The reason for having empty boxes for both video games and board games is to prevent theft and the potential loss of contents, as both are expensive to replace.

		<h1>Subject Access</h1>
		<p>
			The subject vocabulary would be tightly controlled. Since the materials aren’t very diverse, it would be 
			easy to have a subject authority that was fairly consistent.

		<h1>Preservation</h1>
		<p>
			To ensure that the material is well maintained the library will clean discs 
			upon their return. Given that many of the tabletop pieces are durable plastic 
			they do not need much upkeep, cards however can be placed into card sleeves to 
			extend their usability relatively cheaply. In extreme cases lamination can be 
			used to extend the life of the more fragile game components.
